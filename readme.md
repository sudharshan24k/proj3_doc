Certainly! Here's a more **professional, concise, and cloud-ready** version of the 3-week project plan, tailored for documentation and internal planning purposes.

## 📄 Project Plan: UI-Based Configuration File Generator

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: Angular (v20)
* **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)
* **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)
* **Storage**: Local directory structure for generated configuration files

---

### 📅 **Week 1: Prototype Implementation**

#### Objective:

Develop a functional prototype to demonstrate the core concept of generating configuration files based on user-defined parameters.

#### Deliverables:

* Initial Angular UI to capture required config parameters
* Categorization of fields: mandatory, optional, default, dependent
* FastAPI backend setup with Cloud MongoDB integration (MongoDB Atlas)
* API to accept form data and generate corresponding `.json` config files
* Static folder structure created for storing config files per environment

---

### 📅 **Week 2: Feature Expansion & UI Enhancements**

#### Objective:

Enhance backend logic and frontend usability for dynamic, environment-specific configuration handling.

#### Deliverables:

* UI improvements: field validation, grouping, conditional logic (show/hide based on dependencies)
* Backend logic to support multiple environments (UAT, PROD, etc.)
* Dynamic config generation logic and standardized file naming
* Integration of CRUD operations with MongoDB for storing/retrieving config templates
* Ability to view, edit, and regenerate configuration files from stored records

---

### 📅 **Week 3: Testing, Integration & Feedback Implementation**

#### Objective:

Ensure application quality through testing and refine the system based on user feedback.

#### Deliverables:

* Unit and integration testing (API, form submission, MongoDB operations)
* Error handling for invalid input, generation failures, or DB issues
* Review session with internal stakeholders; incorporate functional feedback
* Documentation for parameter structure, form usage, and config rules
* Final optimized build for internal deployment or demo purposes

---

### 📌 Outcome

At the end of 3 weeks, the system will provide a robust UI to define configuration frameworks, persist them using MongoDB Atlas, and generate environment-specific `.json` config files with version-safe organization.

Let me know if you'd like this tailored into a Gantt chart or sprint format.

Certainly! Here's the same 3-week plan presented in a **professional sprint format**, commonly used in Agile documentation for internal projects.

## 📋 Sprint Plan: UI-Based Configuration File Generator

**Project Duration**: 3 Weeks
**Team**: Angular (Frontend) + FastAPI (Backend)
**Database**: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)
**Delivery Model**: Weekly Sprints

---

### 🏁 **Sprint 1: Prototype Development**

**Duration**: Week 1
**Sprint Goal**: Establish basic UI, backend, and config generation functionality

#### ✅ Sprint Backlog

* Setup Angular project structure and initial UI form
* Connect backend FastAPI service to MongoDB Atlas
* Define Pydantic models for config fields (mandatory, optional, dependent)
* Implement API to accept config input and generate `.json` files
* Create basic folder structure for UAT/PROD environments
* Store config metadata in MongoDB

#### 🔄 Deliverables

* Working prototype with config generation
* MongoDB persistence for templates
* Static config folders created per environment

---

### 🏁 **Sprint 2: Feature Development & UI Enhancements**

**Duration**: Week 2
**Sprint Goal**: Add advanced config logic, field dependencies, and enhance UI/UX

#### ✅ Sprint Backlog

* Add dynamic form features (conditional visibility, field dependencies)
* Implement edit/update feature for saved config templates
* Introduce environment selection logic (UAT, PROD, COB)
* Improve file structure and naming conventions for configs
* Enhance user feedback (toasts, validation messages)
* API enhancements to support multiple versions per config type

#### 🔄 Deliverables

* Dynamic, environment-aware UI
* Edit/regenerate existing templates
* MongoDB CRUD for templates completed

---

### 🏁 **Sprint 3: Testing, Integration & Feedback Implementation**

**Duration**: Week 3
**Sprint Goal**: Stabilize, validate, and refine the product based on internal feedback

#### ✅ Sprint Backlog

* Implement unit and integration tests for backend APIs
* UI-level form validations and error boundaries
* Handle backend exceptions and DB edge cases
* Collect internal stakeholder feedback
* Refactor backend logic and UI based on feedback
* Write concise internal usage documentation

#### 🔄 Deliverables

* Tested and validated full-stack config generator
* Improved UI/UX based on feedback
* Internal documentation for usage and maintenance

---

### 📌 Final Outcome (End of Sprint 3)

* Full-stack application to create, manage, and generate config files
* Configurations stored in MongoDB Atlas and output to environment-based folders
* Editable, reusable templates with validation, feedback, and structured versioning
* Ready for internal rollout or demo to extended teams
